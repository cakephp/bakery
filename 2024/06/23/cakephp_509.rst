community reported issues.

Bugfixes
--------

You can expect the following changes in 5.0.9. See the `changelog

- Fixed HTML validation for checkboxes generated by ``FormHelper``.
- ``Table::removeBehavior()`` now cleans up the method map and finder map.
- Improved API documentation for Inflector.
- Removed the check for ``zend.assertions`` when debug is enabled. Cost
  effective hosting often does not provide access to ``php.ini`` and this config
  option cannot be changed.
