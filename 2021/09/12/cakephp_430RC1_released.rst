CakePHP 4.3.0-RC1 Released
==========================

The CakePHP core team is proud to announce the first release candidate of
CakePHP 4.3.0. The 4.3.0 release will introduce several new features and
a handful of deprecations. 

New Features
------------

The `migration guide
<https://book.cakephp.org/4.next/en/appendices/4-3-migration-guide.html>`_ has
a complete list of what's new in 4.3.0. We recommend you give that page a read
when upgrading as it outlines the deprecations present in 4.3.

New Feature Highlights
----------------------

- ``Controller::middleware()`` was added which allows you to define middleware
  for a single controller only.
- ``Http\Client::addMockResponse()`` was added making integration tests easier
  to write without using complex to define mocks.
- A JSON based logger was added.
- ``FormHelper`` generates aria attributes improving out-of-the box
  accessibility.
- A new fixture subsystem leverages your migrations or SQL dumps to generate
  test database schema was added.

How you Can Help
----------------

You can help by trying out the RC in your application. Please open issues for
any new test failures or regressions the new version creates in your
application.
