CakePHP 4.3.2 Released
======================

The CakePHP core team is happy to announce the immediate availability of CakePHP
4.3.2. This is a maintenance release for the 4.3 branch that fixes several
community reported issues.

Bugfixes
--------

You can expect the following changes in 4.3.2. See the `changelog
<https://github.com/cakephp/cakephp/compare/4.3.1...4.3.2>`_ for every commit.

* Added array type coercion to controller actions. Lists of ``,`` separated
  values can now be unpacked into arrays.
* Ensure that ``$defaultTable`` is set in controllers.
* Relaxed version contraints on ``psr/container``.
* Updated cache keys generated by ``Table::get()``. Previously keys were not
  compatible with file based caches. The side-effect of this fix is that cache
  keys will change.
* Added ``_urldecode`` option to route to allow more control on how request URLs
  are decoded.
* Fixed missing milliseconds in log messages.
* Fixed ``Router::reverse()`` not handling parameters created with
  ``Route::setPass()`` properly.
* Added support for ``308`` HTTP status code.
* Removed ``_defaultConfig`` from ``PaginatorComponent`` to fix default
  configuration defined in sub-classes from being ignored.
* Improved API documentation.
