CakePHP 3.10.0 Released
=======================

The CakePHP core team is happy to announce the availability of CakePHP
3.10.0. This is release is a backwards compatible upgrade for 3.x and adds
several new features and backports from the 4.x branch. These backports aim to
ease the upgrade path from 3.x to 4.x.

Extending the 3.x Timeline
--------------------------

Previously 3.9 was the last planned feature release for 3.x and bug fix releases
were planned to stop after *June 15 2021*. Because of continued interest and
usage of 3.x we've decided to extend the 3.x maintenance timeline and release
3.10. The new timelines are:

* 3.10 will continue to receive bug fixes until December 15, 2021.
* 3.10 will continue to receive security fixes until December 15, 2022.

Updating to 3.10.0
------------------

You can use composer to upgrade to the beta version of CakePHP 3.10.0::

    php composer.phar require --update-with-dependencies "cakephp/cakephp:^3.10.0"

What's new in 3.10.0?
---------------------

The shortlist of features included in 3.10 is as follows:

* Improved API documentation.
* Backported improvements to ``Validation::time()`` from 4.x.
