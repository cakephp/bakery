CakePHP 2.x End of Life
=======================

The CakePHP core team would like to remind users that CakePHP 2 reached
End of Life on June 15, 2021. This was after 6 months of security related support
and 18 months after the release of CakePHP 4.0.

We understand there will be projects that must remain on CakePHP 2, but
unfortunately, the core team cannot maintain this version any longer.

CakePHP 3.x End of Life Extended
--------------------------------

We would also like to remind users that End of Life date for CakePHP 3.x was extended
to help support users who have made the transition out of 2.x.

* 3.10 will continue to receive bug fixes until December 15, 2021.
* 3.10 will continue to receive security fixes until December 15, 2022.

With CakePHP 4.3 just aroud the corner and work in CakePHP 5 started, we hope users
are excited about the push for improvements and tastier Cake.
