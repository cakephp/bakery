CakePHP Community 2013
======================

2013 has been an incredible year for us, as it saw the CakePHP
community grow stronger than ever.


CakePHP: the community driven framework
---------------------------------------

We've been very busy, and have a lot to show for it. Late last year we
created the `Community Center`_, as a central location for everyone to
find their way around, and help people get involved with the project.
This year we launched `My CakePHP`_, as a hub for developers to create
a profile, and unify the experience across all of our sites. The `Cake
Software Foundation`_ website also received a well overdue facelift.
Additionally, after continuous requests, and with a little help from
`CakeDC`_, we improved the schedule for the official CakePHP
`training`_, which is now provided on a regular basis.

Earlier this year we also announced our agreement with Microsoft to
make CakePHP available on `Windows Azure`_. That doesn't mean you
can't get your piece of the cake on other platforms, such as
Rackspace's `Cloud Sites`_, Amazon's `Elastic Beanstalk`_ or RedHat's
`OpenShift`_, as well as other PaaS providers, like `Pagoda Box`_ or
`Fortrabbit`_. There's a lot to choose from.

It was also great to see that, since our efforts `last year`_ to
extend the reach of the CakePHP community, both the Facebook `interest
page`_ and our official Twitter `account`_ have reached over 10,000
likes and followers each. The `official group`_ on Facebook also
surpassed 3,000 members, becoming even larger than groups for other
major PHP frameworks. But the growth didn't stop there. We had almost
1 million more visits to the CakePHP sites compared to last year, with
the `CookBook`_ seeing nearly an additional 10 million page views,
reaching over 26 million. For more numbers and stats check out this
year's `community keynote`_.

Which takes us to San Francisco, USA, where we held `CakeFest`_ 2013,
the annual conference dedicated to everything CakePHP. Over 80
developers from around the world joined us for 4 days of workshops and
conference. We listened to your feedback from the previous year and
broke the workshop schedule into beginner and advanced sessions over
the first 2 days. This was then followed by another 2 days of 16 talks
given by 12 international speakers, as well as `keynotes`_,
`lightning`_ `talks`_, `core team`_ Q, and the `raffle`_. We took away
some really `memorable`_ `moments`_, the best of all being the "Hour
of Contribution", where we saw everyone contributing to the project
for an hour, in true open source fashion. It was a beautiful sight,
and a humbling experience. Oh, and who could forget about the `cake`_!

But wait, there's more. Work has been going strong on version `3.0`_
of CakePHP, with the new ORM almost ready for it's first developer
preview release. The `roadmap`_ is slowly being completed, with the
`milestone`_ available for anyone to join in on the fun. In the
meantime, this year saw the release of versions 2.3 and 2.4 of the
framework, with a sum of 28 releases in total. There's also been a lot
of activity in the developer community, with almost 6,000 additional
questions `tagged`_ on Stack Overflow this past year alone. We also
saw `some`_ `interesting`_ `projects`_ released, a couple of
`videos`_, `interviews`_ and `books`_ `published`_, a few `useful`_
`tools`_, as well as some nice `cheat`_ `sheets`_. Not to mention some
`great`_ `initiatives`_, and of course, an honorable mention to core
member Jose Gonzalez, who delivered a total of 25 successive posts on
his blog as part of his CakePHP `advent`_ series. For all our Japanese
developers, there was a `similar`_ series created previous years.

Overall, 2013 was an amazing year, and one to be proud of as a member
of the community! A big thank you goes out to everyone who has been
involved and helped make CakePHP what it is - a framework built by the
community! Thank you.
