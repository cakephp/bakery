CakeFest 2013 - Vote for the location
=====================================

CakeFest 2013 will be happening later in the year. We need your help
to decide the location!

CakeFest 2013 has a number of large communities around the world. Two
of our largest, the USA and Japan, are up for selection for the next
CakePHP conference. We'd like to empower you, the user, to input your
own selection and help us decide where to take the next CakeFest
conference.
