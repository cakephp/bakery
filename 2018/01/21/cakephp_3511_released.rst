CakePHP 3.5.11 Released
=======================

The CakePHP core team is happy to announce the immediate availability of CakePHP
3.5.11. This is a maintenance release for the 3.5 branch that fixes several
community reported issues.

Bugfixes & New Features
-----------------------

You can expect the following changes in 3.5.11. See the `changelog
<https://github.com/cakephp/cakephp/compare/3.5.10...3.5.11>`_ for every commit.

* ``Paginator::options('url')`` now allows prefixes to be disabled by setting
  them to ``false``.
* Route parsing results now include ``_name``. This makes it easier to integrate
  named routes in pagination, and other places where you want to build a URL
  based on the current request's URL.
* Nested namespaces are displayed correctly on development error pages.
* Improved API documentation.
* Cache keys used for groups are now hashed. This prevents keys overflowing
  Redis and Memcache key lengths. This will cause previously cached entries to
  be invalid as group keys have changed.
* TreeBehavior no longer triggers notices after ``setConfig('scope', null)``.
* The default database session configuration no longer triggers errors in
  PHP7.2.0+
