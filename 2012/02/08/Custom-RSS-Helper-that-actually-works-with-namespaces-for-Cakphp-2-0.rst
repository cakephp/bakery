Custom RSS-Helper that actually works with namespaces for Cakphp 2.0
====================================================================

I had a hard time using cakes built in rss helper to create a podcast-
feed for iTunes/iTunes U, because Apple wants us to use custom tags
defined in their own namespace. Namespaces don't work with cakes rss
helper (for now), so I built my own!

I've described my problems in `this thread`_ over in the cakephp
google group.

My own solution consists of a very simple little helper class which I
posted to the bin: `Cakephp bRss Helper`_

For how to use it have a look at the official cakebook `here`_.

But unlike there, use `this layout`_ and `this view`_. Note how I
ignore the 'documentData' and create the surrounding rss tag with the
necessary namespace information "by hand".

Also my helper just constructs the xml as a string without ever using
php's xml object.

I'm aware that this is by no means a good implementation, but it works
for me and there will probably be a fix in the original cakephp helper
at some point. But if you run into the same problems as I did, feel
free to try this solution and also to improve it! You can also just
comment if you have troubles running it.
