CakePHP 5.0.3
=============

The CakePHP core team is happy to announce the immediate availability of CakePHP
5.0.3. This is a maintenance release for the 5.0 branch that fixes several
community reported issues.

Bugfixes
--------

You can expect the following changes in 5.0.3. See the `changelog
<https://github.com/cakephp/cakephp/compare/5.0.2...5.0.3>`_ for every commit.

* Update path to ``plugin_class_error.php``.
* Expanded enum support to include providing a label. Implementing
  ``Cake\Database\Type\EnumLabelInterface`` in your enum class will allow you to
  provide a user facing label. Labels are used by ``FormHelper`` when generating
  controls.
* Improved validation support for enums.
* Widened type of ``$format`` in ``TimeHelper::format()``.
* Support for PHP 8.3
* Fixed significant performance regression in intl date and datetime formatting. Serializing
  dates and datetimes now cache intl formatters restoring performance to 4.x
  levels.
* Improved support for ``binaryuuid`` type across database platforms.
* Improved readability of missing route pages by collapsing the route list by
  default.
* Improve support for indexes on generated columns in SQLite.
* Improved internal tooling for maintaining consistency in split packages.
