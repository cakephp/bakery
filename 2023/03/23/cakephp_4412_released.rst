CakePHP 4.4.12 Released
=======================

The CakePHP core team is happy to announce the immediate availability of CakePHP
4.4.12. This is a maintenance release for the 4.4 branch that fixes several
community reported issues.

Bugfixes
--------

You can expect the following changes in 4.4.12. See the `changelog
<https://github.com/cakephp/cakephp/compare/4.4.11...4.4.12>`_ for every commit.

* Fix regression in ``missing_controller`` template where ``class`` was
  undefined.
* Add opt-in exception wrapping for ``PDOError`` that preserves the
  ``queryString`` attribute used in error templates. This is a workaround for
  dynamic properties being deprecated in PHP 8.2.
* Improve how validation rules work on array elements with numeric keys.
* Fix mutation side-effects in ``TestEmailTransport`` caused by ``Mailer``
  instances being delivered within a loop. These mutations would result in test
  assertions having access to incorrect information.
* Fixed cookie expiration when the default server timezone was ahead of UTC.
* Added additional composer package metadata for PSR interface implementations.
* An exception will now be thrown if the session cannot be started due to
  headers being sent. Previously a hard to understand ``TypeError`` would be
  raised when attempting to write to a session that failed to start.
* ``cake plugin load`` now detects and prevents duplicates.
