Bugfixes
--------

You can expect the following changes in 4.4.14. See the `changelog
<https://github.com/cakephp/cakephp/compare/4.4.14...4.4.14>`_ for every commit.

* Implemented ``SSL XOAUTH2`` support in ``SmtpTransport``. This improves
  compatibility with Microsoft based servers.
* Improve API documentation.
* Fixed support for postgres schemas other than ``public`` in Fixture schema generation.
* ``Validation::utf8()`` and by extension the ``Validator::utf8()`` method as
  well now fail on invalid UTF8 bytes even when the extended range is enabled.

  in standalone package usage.
