An ElasticSearch powered Search Index - your data stays in `default`
====================================================================

Use ElasticSearch for your searches, but keep your data in
MySQL/Postgres (your default DB config). This behavior saves an
"index" string to ElasticSearch for each record afterSave, and
searches happen against that, but your data is exactly as it was
before.


Elastic Search Index
====================

`https://github.com/zeroasterisk/CakePHP-ElasticSearchIndex`_

This plugin allow for a very easy search index powered
by`ElasticSearch`_ with all kinds of`Lucene`_ powered goodness. *(it
powers GitHub)*

With this, you keep your models on your own normal (default)
datasource. All saves and finds and joins and callbacks... normal.

But when you attach this behavior, you now have additional callbacks
which gather the data you want to use as a search index... it stores
that data to ElasticSearch via it's own datasource, ` index` as setup
via the (above) Elastic plugin.

What you end up with is having you cake and eating it too.

+ Your Model and datasource are unchanged and work as before. ** all
  your data is still where it has always been ** you can still do joins
  ** non-search conditions can still work on the normal fields
+ The searchy goodness of ElasticSearch / Lucene is avaialble to you
  ** The indexed string for each record is a customizable second copy of
  the data's text ** It's avaialble on ElasticSearch for any other usage
  as well

Now you can search by

+ term: `foo`
+ multi-term: `foobar`
+ partials: `fo*`
+ partials in the front: `*oo`
+ phrases: `"foobar"`
+ fuzzy term: `~bars` *(prefix with ` ~`)*
+ ... and more ... (suggestions?)

*Note: it is working great, but we could use more ElasticSearch
special sauce if you want to help improve it.*


Install
-------

Get this plugin into place

::

     `
    git submodule add https://github.com/zeroasterisk/CakePHP-ElasticSearchIndexapp/Plugin/ElasticSearchIndex
    #or
    git clone https://github.com/zeroasterisk/CakePHP-ElasticSearchIndexapp/Plugin/ElasticSearchIndex

    `

And install the`Icing`_ Plugin

::

     `
    gitsubmoduleaddhttps://github.com/AudiologyHoldings/Icingapp/Plugin/Icing
    #or
    gitclonehttps://github.com/AudiologyHoldings/Icingapp/Plugin/Icing

    `

In ` app/Config/bootstrap.php` load the plugin

::

     `
    CakePlugin::load('Icing');
    CakePlugin::load('ElasticSearchIndex');

    `

Copy the default ` ElasticSearchRequest` configuration into your app
and edit it to suit your setup.

::

     `
    cpapp/Plugin/Icing/Config/elastic_search_request.php.defaultapp/Config/elastic_search_request.php

    `

Note that there's a ` default` config and a ` test` config which will
override the ` default` config... But only if your tests set the
following Configure variable:

::

     `
    Configure::write('inUnitTest',true);

    `



Now setup into any Models you want to search / index
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In your ` Model` add this behavior

::

     `
    public$actsAs=array(
    'ElasticSearchIndex.ElasticSearchIndexable'=>array(),
    );

    `

And here are the behaviour config options, with default values

::

     `
    public$actsAs=array(
    'ElasticSearchIndex.ElasticSearchIndexable'=>array(
    //urltotheelasticsearchindexforthismodel/table
    'url'=>null,
    //extraconfigforElasticSearchRequest(parsedfromURL)
    'index'=>null,
    //extraconfigforElasticSearchRequest(parsedfromURL,ordefaultedto$Model->useTable)
    'table'=>null,
    //limitthesearchresultstothismanyresults
    'limit'=>200,
    //detailsneededtolinktoModel
    'foreignKey'=>false,//primaryKeytosaveagainst
    //dowebuildtheindexaftersave?(yes...)
    'rebuildOnUpdate'=>true,
    //whenwebuildtheindex,considerthesefields(ignonredifcustommethodonmodel)
    //eg:array('title','name','email','city','state','country'),
    //orforall(text/varchar)fields:'*'
    'fields'=>'*',
    //whenwebuildtheindex,dowefinddatafirst?(iffalse,weonlyhavethedatawhichwassaved)
    'queryAfterSave'=>true,
    //optionalconfigforHttpSocket(bettertoconfigureElasticSearchRequest)
    'request'=>array(),
    ),
    );

    `



How to Save Records
-------------------

It's automatic, after every save , the behaviour will post that record
to the ElasticSearch index.

If you want to manually index any model ` $data` arrays (with the
fields from this model), in your ` Model` you can do:

::

     `
    $data=$this->read(null,'1234');
    $id=$data[$this->alias][$this->primaryKey];
    $success=$this->saveToIndex($id,$data);

    `

If you have a simple string, you want to index for a record on your `
Model` then you can use:

::

     `
    $id='1234';
    $success=$this->saveIndexDataToIndex($id,'Thisisacustomstring,thiswillbeindexed');

    `



Customize the data to save to the Index
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can specify a few methods on your model, which override the basic
functionality.

Make this method on your model to get customized data for the
indexing. It should return a data array for a single record, similar
to a ` find('first')`

::

     `
    $findFirstData=$this->getDataForIndex($id)

    `

Make this method on your Model to process a data array into a string
for indexing.

It expects to get it's data array from ` $this->data` not from a
passed in argument

It should return a string (the text which will be stored in the index)

::

     `
    $indexText=$this->indexData()

    `

Make this method on your Model to clean or post-process the index
text. You can replace terms, characters or whatever you like.

::

     `
    $indexText=$this->cleanForIndex($indexText)

    `



How to re-index all Records
---------------------------

In any Model you can run ` reIndexAll($conditions)` and it will walk
through your data and re-index all of them... it can be really slow...

::

     `
    //thisisreallyslow,butitwillre-indexeverything(create/updateindexes)
    $statusString=$this->reIndexAll();
    //oryoucanpassinanyconditionsyouliketolimitthescopeofthereIndex
    $statusString=$this->reIndexAll(array(
    'modified>'=>date('Y-m-d00:00:00',strtotime('-2months')),
    ));

    `



How to Search
-------------

The core search method for this behavior is `
searchAndReturnAssociationKeys` which returns just the ` id`s of the `
Model`.

::

     `
    $primaryKeys=$this->searchAndReturnAssociationKeys($term);

    `

And with ` $optionsForElasticSearchRequest` ( ` limit`, ` page`).

::

     `
    $primaryKeys=$this->searchAndReturnAssociationKeys($term,$optionsForElasticSearchRequest);

    `

This is a really useful method, it can easily be added to any `
conditions` array.

::

     `
    $conditions=array(
    "{$this->alias}.{$this->primaryKey}"=>$this->searchAndReturnAssociationKeys('SearchTerm'),
    );

    `

If you are using the `CakeDC/search`_ plugin, you can use this to make
subquery or query filters... (which is sweet!)


How to Search with results Sorted by best match
-----------------------------------------------

Search results are usually sorted by which results are the best match
for the search term.

::

     `
    $sortedIds=$this->searchAndReturnAssociationKeys('SearchTerm');
    $results=$this->find('all',array(
    'conditions'=>array(
    "{$this->alias}.{$this->primaryKey}"=>$sortedIds
    )
    ));
    $results=$this->searchResultsResort($results,$sortedIds);

    `



Convenience Search, Resort, and Return Data
-------------------------------------------

If you want to just get search results, without any other conditions,
it's really simple:

::

     `
    $findAllResults=$this->search($term)

    `

And here are all the possible paramters...

::

     `
    $findAllResults=$this->search($term,$optionsForFindAll,$optionsForElasticSearchRequest);

    `



Background
----------

This project is based in large part on the`Searchable/SearchIndex`_
Plugin/Behavior and my former fork of it. The original version stored
all of the index data into a MySQL table with a full-text-index. That
worked pretty well, but it only worked with the MyISAM table engine
and it doesn't offer all the sweet search syntax/features.

Initially, this was using the`Elasitc`_ Plugin/Datasource and it
worked ok... but there were un-necissary complications due to the data
storage patter (as CakePHP nested models) and because all of the data
for all of the models was stored in the same "table" on ElasticSearch.
Also the Elastic model required curl, not bad but not needed.

Now ElasticSearchIndex is using`Icing.Lib/ElasticSearch`_. for
interactions with ElasticSearch.

It's a little odd to interact with a "database" not through a
"datasource" but the Lib is really an extension of the HttpSocket
utility, and it's indended to facilitate both a raw interactions
(where you manually create whatever data you want to send) and it has
tools to help automate simple data to pass.
