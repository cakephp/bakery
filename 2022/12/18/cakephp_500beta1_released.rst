CakePHP 5.0.0-beta1 Released
============================

The CakePHP core team is proud to announce the first beta release of CakePHP
5.0.0. This initial release contains most of the new features and breaking
changes that 5.0 will contain. This release contains a minimal working
application skeleton. It also features a new version of Chronos with several
breaking changes.

Our focus in the near future is to finish updating all of the CakePHP maintained
plugins to be compatible with 5.0. We'll also be putting more work into
backporting deprecations into the next 4.x release (4.5.0) so that upgrading can
be done incrementally before 5.x is released.

Finally, the scope for 5.x isn't locked down so if you'd like to see a feature
or breaking change made please `open an issue
<https://github.com/cakephp/cakephp/issues/new>`__.

New Features
------------

The `migration guide
<https://book.cakephp.org/5.0/en/appendices/5-0-migration-guide.html>`_ has
a complete list of what's new in 5.0.0. We recommend you give that page a read
when upgrading as it notes the various breaking changes present in 5.0.

How you Can Help
----------------

You can help deliver 5.0 by contributing in one of many ways:

#. Check the `documentation <https://book.cakephp.org/5.0/en/>`_ for mistakes,
   outdated, unclear or broken examples. We've been trying to update everything
   but may have not caught everything.
#. Try it out! Give CakePHP 5.0 a test drive in a non-production application.
   We'd love to hear how converting a small application went and what was harder
   than it should have been.
#. File issues for regressions in existing features, or suggest new features.
   While we're not likely to greatly expand the scope of 5.0, we would like
   input on what should be a part of 5.1 and 5.2.
