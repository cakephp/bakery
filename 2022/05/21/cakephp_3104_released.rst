CakePHP 3.10.4 Released
=======================

The CakePHP core team is happy to announce the immediate availability of CakePHP
3.10.4. This is a maintenance and security release for the 3.10 branch that
fixes a community reported issue, and patches a security vulnerability.

Security Fixes
--------------

The 3.10.4 release fixes an encoding issue with the verified tokens feature
of ``CsrfProtectionMiddleware`` released in 3.10.3. In 3.10.3 verfied tokens
were generated using random bytes and would often fail to match as the bytes
would be incorrectly encoded when rendered in HTML.

Bugfixes
--------

You can expect the following changes in 3.10.4. See the `changelog
<https://github.com/cakephp/cakephp/compare/3.10.3...3.10.4>`_ for every commit.

* Fixed incorrectly encoded CSRF tokens when using the ``verifyTokenSource``
  option.
