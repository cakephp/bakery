CakePHP 3.10.3 Released
=======================

The CakePHP core team is happy to announce the immediate availability of CakePHP
3.10.3. This is a maintenance and security release for the 3.10 branch that
fixes a couple community reported issues, and patches a security vulnerability.

Security Fixes
--------------

The 3.10.3 release contains an *opt in* security fix for
``CsrfProtectionMiddleware``. Prior to this release, if an application has
a cross-site-scripting vulnerability, or an attacker has access to a victim's browser
CSRF tokens could be manipulated allowing CSRF bypass. This weakness stems from
CSRF middleware accepting any matching pair of tokens. With the fix applied,
only tokens generated by the host application will be accepted. This fix
requires opt-in because it breaks compatibility with existing CSRF tokens that
may be in user's browsers/sessions. To enable the new style tokens add the
following::

    // in src/Application.php
    $middlewareQueue->add(new CsrfProtectionMiddleware([
        'verifyTokenSource' => true
    ]));

Bugfixes
--------

You can expect the following changes in 3.10.3. See the `changelog
<https://github.com/cakephp/cakephp/compare/3.10.2...3.10.3>`_ for every commit.

* Fixed a memory leak in ``TranslatorRegistry`` when loading translations from
  cache.
