======================

The CakePHP core team is happy to announce the immediate availability of CakePHP
4.4.2. This is a maintenance release for the 4.4 branch that fixes several
community reported issues.

Bugfixes
--------

You can expect the following changes in 4.4.2. See the `changelog
<https://github.com/cakephp/cakephp/compare/4.4.1...4.4.2>`_ for every commit.

* Updated constraints on laminas packages.
* Improved ``EntityTrait::_accessible`` type annotation.
* Added the ``encrypt`` and ``trustServerCertificate`` options to
  ``SqlServerDriver``.
* When ``viewClasses()`` based extension driven content-negotiation fails
  a ``NotFoundException`` will now be raised.
* Fixed ``ServerRequest::is('xml')`` from returning true on the default
  ``Accept`` header sent by Chrome and Firefox.
