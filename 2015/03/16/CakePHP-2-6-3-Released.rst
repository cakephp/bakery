CakePHP 2.6.3 Released
======================

The CakePHP core team is proud to announce the immediate availability
of CakePHP 2.6.3.

The CakePHP core team is proud to announce the immediate availability
of CakePHP 2.6.3. 2.6.3 is a bugfix release for the 2.6 release
branch. A short list of the changes you can expect is:

+ The postgres driver can now convert text fields into integer fields
  through SchemaShell.
+ Files with `..` in their name can now be downloaded through
  CakeResponse.
+ LC_TIME messages are ignored when extracting messages via the
  I18nShell. Previously, incompatible po files were extracted for
  LC_TIME messages.
+ Fence post errors were fixed in CakeEmail when sending messages with
  lines equal to 999 bytes.
+ Words with WWW in the middle are no longer autolinked by TextHelper.
+ PaginatorComponent now handles order conditions like Model::find()
  does.
+ Maxlength attributes are no longer generated by FormHelper for
  decimal fields. In 2.6.2 maxlength was corrected, however, the fix
  added in 2.6.2 made it impossible to use the full length of decimal
  columns.
+ The limit and maxLimit settings for PaginatorComponent are now
  independent.
+ Model's whitelist is no longer empty in afterSave.
+ Class names in Scaffold errors are now correct.
