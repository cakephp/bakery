from the 28th until the 31st of May, and experience the very best of Open Source!
Visit https://cakefest.org for info and tickets.

The biggest CakePHP event, ever!
--------------------------------

This year we’re celebrating the stable release of 3.0, as well as an
incredible 10 years of CakePHP and Open Source with the whole community.
This is a huge milestone for the project, so we couldn’t think of
anywhere better than the awesome city of New York, USA.

Workshops
~~~~~~~~~

The 2 days of workshops at CakeFest are the perfect opportunity to learn
the best parts of CakePHP 3.0 with core developers, and a great way to
get up to speed with all the new features included in the latest major
version of the framework. You’ll also receive your own certificate of
attendance.

This year we have both basic and advanced workshops, from getting the
most out of CakePHP, to going deep into the internals of the framework,
allowing both beginners and veterans to get a piece of the cake!

Conference
~~~~~~~~~~

Covering 2 full days of keynotes, presentations and talks on CakePHP and
related technologies, the conference portion of CakeFest is an event you
don’t want to miss, for both enthusiasts and newcomers to the framework.
It’s a unique time to engage and network with the community, learn from
other experienced developers, and hang out with the core team! See
https://cakefest.org/schedule for more details.
